      <div id="Florian" class="abstract" style="display:none"> 
	  Suppose that $F/\mathbb{Q}_p$ is a finite unramified extension. When $F = \mathbb{Q}_p$, Emerton
showed that the mod-p local Langlands correspondence is realized globally
in the mod-p cohomology of modular curves. For larger $F$, the mod-p local
Langlands correspondence of $\mathrm{GL}_2(F)$ is unknown, but it is interesting to
study the subrepresentations of the mod-p cohomology of Shimura curves cut
out by a global Galois representation, in analogy with $F = \mathbb{Q}_p$. Under some
reasonable hypotheses we prove that these representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2(F)$ are
of finite length, as was expected since the work of Breuil-Paskunas from
around 2007. This is joint work with C. Breuil, Y. Hu, S. Morra, and B.
Schraen.

<div id="Adrian" class="abstract" style="display:none">
<p>   In 2001, Conrey, Farmer, Keating, Rubinstein, and Snaith developed a "recipe" utilizing heuristic arguments to predict the asymptotics of moments of various families of L-functions. This heuristic was later extended by Andrade and Keating to include moments and ratios of the family of L-functions associated to hyperelliptic curves of genus g over a fixed finite field. </p>
<p>   In joint work with Bergström, Petersen, and Westerland, we related the moment conjecture of Andrade and Keating to the problem of understanding the homology of the braid group with symplectic coefficients. We computed the stable homology groups of the braid groups with these coefficients, together with their structure as Galois representations, and showed that the answer matches the number-theoretic predictions. Our results, combined with a recent homological stability theorem of Miller, Patzt, Petersen, and Randal-Williams, imply the conjectured asymptotics for all moments in the function field case, for all large enough odd prime powers $q$.</p>

<div id="Aubert" class="abstract" style="display:none"> 
<p> The decomposition into Bernstein blocks of the category of smooth representations of a $p$-adic group $G$ admits a Galois analogue in terms of enhanced $L$-parameters, in which the role of supercuspidal representations is played by « cuspidal » enhanced $L$-parameters, a notion that originates in the construction by Lusztig of the generalized Springer correspondence.</p>
<p> We will formulate sufficient conditions to be satisfied by the local Langlands correspondence for the supercuspidal representations of the Levi subgroups of G in order to allow to construct a canonical bijection between the associated blocks on both sides.</p>
<p> Next, we will prove that, when these conditions are satisfied, every compound $L$-packet of G contains at least one irreducible representation with non-singular supercuspidal support.</p>
<p> The conditions evacuated above are notably satisfied when $G$ is the exceptional group $G_2$, and when G is a classical group.  We will show that, for every irreducible $p$-adic ortho-symplectic dual pair $(G, G')$, the Howe correspondence can be described as a collection of correspondences between simple modules of affine Hecke algebras attached to the Bernstein blocks of enhanced $L$-parameters of $G$ and $G^′$.</p>

    <div id="Jared" class="abstract" style="display:none"> 
	The local Langlands correspondence (LLC) is a conjectural finite-to-one map from representations of a p-adic reductive group G
to the set of L-parameters for G. Recently there have been two major advances in this area:  Kaletha's characterization of the LLC in terms of explicit character formulas and harmonic analysis, and 
then a more geometric construction, due to Fargues-Scholze, involving excursion operators.  This talk represents work in progress on what happens when you marry these approaches:  you can write down an expected formula for the excursion operator, assuming Kaletha's formulas.   Interestingly, the excursion operator is convolution with a function, the "excursion function", which comes entirely out of harmonic analysis.

	  I will talk about recent work (joint with Boeckle, Iyengar, Manning, Urban) that studies situations when one can prove isomorphism of deformation rings R and Hecke rings T without them being complete intersections. Our work has led to new algebraic  invariants which capture the failure of R=T to be isomorphisms of complete intersections. One can try and  relate these new invariants to the numerical invariants like Tamagawa factors that appear in the  formula conjectured by Block-Kato for the special value  L(1,Ad_f) of the adjoint motive associated to a newform f  of weight at least 2. One  is led to make new guesses about the relation of the higher congruence numbers (defined in work with Iyengar and Manning)  associated to Kisin’s local deformation  rings at   at the augmentation induced by f and  the  Tamagawa numbers  of the adjoint motive of f. The talk will summarize known results and conclude with some more speculative thoughts.

      <div id="Lie" class="abstract" style="display:none"> Trianguline representations are a big class of $p$-adic representations that contain all nice enough (cristalline) ones but allow a continuous variation of weights. The trianguline deformation ring is defined as the Zariski closure of such representations in certain ambient spaces. We give a new definition of trianguline deformation rings in 2 dimensional cases as the support of certain modules, so that one does not need to take Zariski closure. It is also integral in nature and can be seen to be compatible with Emerton's Jacquet functor.

      <div id="Xinwen" class="abstract" style="display:none"> Studying the étale cohomology of Shimura varieties with Hecke and Galois actions provides an avenue toward understanding the Langlands correspondence.
While the structure of the rational cohomology groups is predicted by conjectures of Kottwitz and Arthur,
the integral or mod $\ell$ cohomology groups are more intricate. Although a conjectural formula exists for computing these groups, it relies on an additional conjecture on the existence of moduli spaces of global Galois representations.
However,  much more can be said if we focus on these cohomology groups with Hecke and local Galois actions. Specifically,
I will present an unconditional formula for computing the mod $\ell$ cohomology groups of many Shimura varieties with Iwahori level at $p(\neq \ell$), expressed in terms of coherent sheaves on the moduli space of local Galois representations. This result not only provides evidence supporting the aforementioned conjectures but also has surprising arithmetic applications.

	I will first present a formulation of the strong Brumer—Stark conjecture. Equivariant Tamagawa Number Conjecture (ETNC) is a refinement of the strong Brumer—Stark conjecture that gives a formula for the “equivariant” leading term of Artin L-functions of odd characters of totally real fields at s=0. I will sketch a proof of the ETNC. It uses the Euler systems argument and is inspired by the work of Bullach—Burns—Daoud—Seo. This is a joint work with Dasgupta, Silliman and Wang.

      <div id="Tsimerman" class="abstract" style="display:none">
(Joint with Ben Bakker) Given an Elliptic curve E with complex multiplication, it is known that E has (potentially) good reduction everywhere. Concretely, this means that the j-invariant of E is an algebraic integer. The generalization of this result to Abelian-Varieties follows from the Neron-Ogg-Shafarevich criterion for good reduction.

We generalize this result to Exceptional Shimura varieties S. Concretely, we show that there exists some integral model S_0 of S such that all special points of S extend to (algebraically) integral points of S_0. To prove this we establish a Neron-Ogg-Shafarevich criterion in this setting. Our methods are general and apply, in particular, to arbitrary variations of hodge structures with an immersive Kodaira-Spencer map.

We will explain the proof (which is largely in the realm of birational p-adic geometry) and the open questions that remain.
