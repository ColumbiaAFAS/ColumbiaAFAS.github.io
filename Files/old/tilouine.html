Abstract:  There is a substantial difference between the theory of congruences of p-adic
families of automorphic forms to induced ones and that to symmetric powers. 
The difference lies in the dimensions of the    
families involved. However, the comparison with the Galois level of the families 
still holds in both cases.
This is a report on works with Hida, and by Conti and Chen.
