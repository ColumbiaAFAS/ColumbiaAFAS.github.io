Abstract: Question about decomposition of representations of groups over local fields
to subgroups, such as from SO(n) to SO(n-1), has been of considerable interest in the recent past with impressive works of Waldspurger, Moeglin-Waldspurger, and Raphael Beuzart-Plessis. Corresponding global question for unitary groups has been partly settled  
by Wei Zhang.
