<span style="font-weight: bold;">  Spin L-functions for GSp(6) </span></small><br>
<small><small><br>
<small>

This talk is on work in progress with Aaron Pollack.  We give three global integrals unfolding to the partial Spin L-function on GSp(6).  One of these integrals has been previously considered by Gan-Gurevich, but restricted to a class of CAP forms, while another generalizes the integral of Kohnen-Skoruppa on GSp(4).  These three integrals unfold to the same non-unique model, which we analyze using an extension of the method of Piatetski-Shapiro and Rallis.  We expect these integrals to be nonvanishing for a class of non-generic cuspidal representations on GSp(6).
