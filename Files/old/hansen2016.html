 Abstract: Much of classical p-adic Hodge theory can be reinterpreted "geometrically" on the Fargues-Fontaine curve, in terms of vector bundles and modifications of vector bundles.  After recalling this dictionary between "classical" and "geometric" p-adic Hodge theory, I'll describe some very general results which (roughly) allow one to put a canonical filtration (or several such filtrations) on a modification of vector bundles, both pointwise and (more subtly) in families.  I'll also explain some particular applications of these results to a conjecture of Harris on the cohomology of moduli spaces of local shtukas, and to the geometry of p-adic period domains.
