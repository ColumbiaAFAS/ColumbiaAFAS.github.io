ABSTRACT: It may be asked how "small" a set of representatives for isogeny classes (up to isomorphism) of elliptic curves over $\overline\Q$ may be found. For instance, any open set in the $j$-plane $\C$ suffices to represent every isogeny class, but no finite set does. In joint work with Masser we have proved in particular that no real algebraic curve in the $j$-plane (i.e. defined by a polynomial equation $f(\Re j, \Im j)=0$) may suffice (though a transcendental curve may do). This remains true also if we do not require to represent isogeny classes of "special", i.e. CM, curves.

<br>
The method of proof extends to give new and different answers to questions of Katz-Oort, compared to work by Tsimerman; such context concerns proving the existence of principally polarized abelian varieties of given dimension, defined over $\overline\Q$ and not isogenous to any abelian variety in a given subvariety of the moduli space.
