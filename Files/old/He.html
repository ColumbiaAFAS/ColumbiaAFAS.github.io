Abstract:  The problem of the reduction modulo p of a Shimura variety has 
a long and complicated history, perhaps beginning with Kronecker. It is 
known that the modular curve has good reduction at $p$ if the level 
structure is prime to $p$. If the level structure is of  
$\Gamma_0(p)$-type, then the modular curve has semi-stable reduction. 
Are there other level structures such that the reduction modulo $p$ is 
good, resp. is semi-stable?

A more precise interpretation of the question is to ask for good, resp. 
semi-stable, reduction of a specific class of $p$-integral models of 
Shimura varieties. It is known for a long time that the Drinfeld case 
has the semi-stable reduction. Very recently, Faltings discovered a new 
case of semi-stable reduction. This triggered our interest in the 
classification of semi-stable local models. In this talk, I will discuss 
the classification of the good and semi-stable reductions. It is based 
on a joint work with G. Pappas and M. Rapoport.
