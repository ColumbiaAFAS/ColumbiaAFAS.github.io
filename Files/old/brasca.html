Abstract: The notion of ordinary modular form is meaningless if the ordinary locus of the relevant Shimura variety is empty, so it seems impossible to generalize Hida theory to this situation. We can nevertheless replace the ordinary locus by the so called mu-ordinary locus introduced by Wedhorn, that is always not empty. In this talk we will explain how to generalize Hida theory over the mu-ordinary locus in some cases.
