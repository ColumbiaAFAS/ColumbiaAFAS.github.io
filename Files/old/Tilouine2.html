Abstract: 
 It follows from works by Hida and Wiles that under certain conditions 
-including minimality and residual irreducibility,
the Bloch-Kato conjecture holds for the adjoint motive of an elliptic cusp form.
In a joint work with E. Urban, we prove under 
similar assumptions that it also holds 
for any (real or imaginary) quadratic twist of the adjoint motive 
of an elliptic cusp form.
