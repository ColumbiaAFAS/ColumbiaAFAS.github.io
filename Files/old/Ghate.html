Abstract: 

We use the compatibility between the p-adic and mod p Local Langlands
Correspondences to compute the reductions of certain crystalline
representations
of the local Galois group of Q_p. The reduction is now essentially
completely known
for all slopes smaller than 2, thanks to joint work with Shalini
Bhattacharaya, and
also with Sandra Rozensztajn for the case of slope 1. We shall speak about
these works,
contrasting the behavior of the reduction in the fractional and integral
slope cases.
