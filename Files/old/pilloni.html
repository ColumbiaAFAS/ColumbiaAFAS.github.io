<small><small><br>
<small>

 We prove, under some mild assumptions, that eigensystems occuring in  the coherent cohomology of a PEL shimura varieties are  p-adic limits of   eigensystems coming from cuspidal, regular modular forms. As a consequence, we can associate Galois representations to automorphic forms which are at infinity non-degenerate limits of discrete series. The proof uses some strange formal models introduced by Scholze. This is a joint work with Stroh.
