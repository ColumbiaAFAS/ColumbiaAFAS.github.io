Abstract:  I will talk about some recent work with Chantal David and Matilde Lalin about the mean value of L-functions associated to cubic characters over F_q[t] when q=1 (mod 3). I will explain how to obtain an asymptotic formula which relies on obtaining cancellation in averages of cubic Gauss sums over functions fields. I will also talk about the corresponding non-Kummer case when q=2 (mod 3) and I will explain why this setting is somewhat easier to handle than the Kummer case, which allows us to prove some better results.
