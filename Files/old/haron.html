Abstract: We shall give a simple generalization of commutative rings.  The
category GR of such generalized rings contains ordinary commutative
rings (fully, faithfully), but also the "integers" and the "residue
field" at a real or complex place of a number field ; the "field with
one element" F1 (the initial object of GR) ; the "Arithmetical Surface"
(the categorical sum of the integers Z with them self).   We shall show
this geometry sees the real and complex places of a number field K : the
valuation sub GR of K correspond to the finite and infinite primes of K,
and there is a compactification of the spectrum of the integers of K.
One can develope algebraic geometry using generalized rings following
Grothendieck's paradigm, with Quillen's homotopical algebra replacing
homological algebra.   There is a theory of differentials which satisfy
all the usual properties,  as well as an analogue of Quillen's cotangent
complex.  We compute the differentials of the integers Z over F1.  We
associate with any compact topological valuation generalized ring its
zeta function so that for the p-adic integers we get the usual factor of
zeta, while for the real integers we get the gamma factor.   Finally we
describe the remarkable ordinary (!) commutative ring one obtains from
the Arithmetical surface Z(x)Z .
