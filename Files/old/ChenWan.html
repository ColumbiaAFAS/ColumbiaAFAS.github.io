Abstract: Following the method developed by Waldspurger and Beuzart-Plessis in their proof of the local Gan-Gross-Prasad conjecture, we were able to prove the multiplicity one theorem on Vogan L-packet for the Ginzburg-Rallis model. In some cases, we can also relate the multiplicity to the central value of epsilon factor.
