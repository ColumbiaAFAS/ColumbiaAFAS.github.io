Abstract: I'll present a formula relating the intersection of two different Heegner-Drinfeld cycles to the r-th derivative of an automorphic L-function.  This is a "higher-order" generalization of the Gross-Kohnen-Zagier formula, in the function field setting, and is inspired by recent work of Yun and W. Zhang.  Our formula gives strong evidence that all Heegner-Drinfeld cycles are colinear in cohomology.  This is joint work with Ben Howard.
